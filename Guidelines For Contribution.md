> Try to keep the same file strucutre as show above. Any suggestions to file structure can be made by opeining a new issue.

## How to Add Code

### For Problems

Move into the respective folder namely `LeetCode`, `CodeForces` and `CodeChef`. If your code doesn't belong to any of the above mentioned, feel free to create one.

After you're done with the code, update the [README.md](https://github.com/himakhaitan/CP-Directory) file you find in that folder mentioning the problem name lexicographically.

*(Make sure you don't change the [README.md](https://github.com/himakhaitan/CP-Directory) in root of project but the [README.md](https://github.com/himakhaitan/CP-Directory) in folder of language you're working.)*

### For Data Structure and Algorithms

Check for the respective topic related folder you want to contribute in. If it is not present do feel free to create one.

### For Notes

You don't need to create issue for contributing in notes. Simply add points/heading to Notes.

[Notes.md](https://github.com/himakhaitan/CP-Directory/blob/main/Notes.md) contains small and little points about DSA one should know from the interview perspective. Feel free to add any such points.

Any further points or headings can be added to Notes depending on how relavant it is to the purpose.

Some of the examples are:

- Tricks
- Term & It's Definition
- Many More

### For Assets

You don't need to create issue for contributing in assets. Simply add the file in the asset folder.

## After The Code/File is Added

```
-   Commit the changes to the repository
-   Create a pull request
-   You've done your job. Now wait for it to get reviewed and approved by maintainers :)
```

## MUST READ NOTES FOR THE CONTRIBUTOR
1. You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you. Issues will be assigned on a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE (FCFS) basis. The person who creates the issue gets the first priority. And then, issues are assigned based on who commented first. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned and the programming language you are going to use, and it will be done if found fit.
2. Don't forget to add the following things to your code (The PR will not get accepted if these are not present) -
    A. Proper comments wherever necessary.<br>
    B. A block comment at the start of the code containing the problem number, problem name and problem statement or problem url.<br>
    C. After the code, a block comment having sample input, sample output, time complexity of the solution and space complexity of the solution.<br>
3. PLEASE DO NOT COPY THE CODE, PLAGIARIZED CONTRIBUTIONS DO NOT ADD TO YOUR SKILLS!
